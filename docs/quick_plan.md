I'll create a plan for these tasks. Let me first explore the current structure to understand what needs to be done.

Now I'll create a detailed plan for these tasks:

## Quick Plan Summary

I've created a detailed task breakdown for your requirements:

### **Backend (~5 min)**
- **Task**: Add `portrait_img` column to `resume_records` table
  - Create SQL migration file
  - Update Go model in `server/model/resume.go`

### **Frontend (~70 min total)**

#### **V2 Editor System (path: `/editor/v2/:id`)** - ~55 min
The new V2 structure uses a block-based approach:
```typescript
{
  "title": "教育背景",
  "type": "list" | "text",
  "data": [
    {id, name, description, time, highlight}
  ] | "text content"
}
```

**Tasks:**
1. **Types** (~5 min): Define V2 resume block types
2. **Main Page** (~15 min): Create `ResumeDetailsV2.tsx`
3. **Editor Component** (~20 min): Build block-based editor (handles both list and text types)
4. **Chat Panel** (~10 min): Adapt for V2 structure
5. **Router** (~5 min): Add `/editor/v2/:id` route

#### **Job-Resume Page Redesign** - ~15 min
Transform `/job-resume` page:
- **Left side**: Large textarea for job description input
- **Right side**: Resume uploader (reuse logic from `/simple-resume`)
- **Submit**: Upload → Call workflow with `{resume_text, job_description}` → Navigate to `/editor/v2/:id#jd`

### Implementation Notes:
- V2 uses version number `2` in `structured_data` or as a flag
- Each block is independent with its own title and type
- List items are structured objects; text blocks are simple strings
- The JD hash (`#jd`) will signal the page came from job matching flow

Would you like me to proceed with implementation, or would you like to discuss/adjust the plan first?
